          <p>At the age of 27, Connor faced a profound life-altering challenge when he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. This diagnosis, marked by persistent auditory hallucinations, plunged him into a tumultuous period that lasted for two years. During this time, he depleted his financial resources, strained relationships, and endured multiple arrests and hospitalizations. Connor's struggle with mental illness led to homelessness, with periods spent living in hotels and a tent outside a Starbucks in Carlsbad, California. His journey to recovery was arduous, involving attempts with various medications and battling the misconception that he did not have a mental illness.</p>
          <p>By the grace of God, Connor eventually found recovery through Invega, a leading antipsychotic long-acting injectable medication. Despite experiencing detached emotions and psychotic episodes since childhood, he remained resilient, aided by the unwavering support of his family. Following his recovery, Connor embarked on a real estate investing career while on disability, having persevered through the challenges of untreated mental illness. Today, he thrives as a content, healthy individual, rapidly expanding his real estate portfolio and extending support to others seeking similar success.</p>

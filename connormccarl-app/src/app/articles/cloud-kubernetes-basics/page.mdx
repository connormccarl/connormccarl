# New Cloud Technologies - Kubernetes Basics

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is a powerful system for managing containerized applications in a clustered environment. It provides mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

## Key Components of Kubernetes

- **Nodes:** The worker machines that run containerized applications.
- **Pods:** The smallest deployable units, consisting of one or more containers.
- **Services:** Abstracts a set of pods and provides a stable endpoint.
- **Deployments:** Manages the deployment and scaling of pod replicas.

## Why Use Kubernetes?

- **Scalability:** Automatically scale applications based on demand.
- **Resilience:** Self-healing capabilities to restart failed containers.
- **Portability:** Works across different environments, from local to cloud.

## Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster

### Step 1: Install Minikube

Minikube is a tool that sets up a local Kubernetes cluster on your machine.

```bash
# Install Minikube
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
chmod +x minikube
sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

### Step 2: Start Minikube

```bash
# Start Minikube
minikube start
```

### Step 3: Deploy an Application

Create a deployment YAML file.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Apply the deployment.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Step 4: Expose the Deployment

Expose the deployment as a service.

```bash
kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --type=NodePort --port=80
```

## Conclusion

Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications at scale. Its features enable efficient deployment, scaling, and maintenance, making it an essential technology for modern cloud-native applications.

# New Cloud Technologies - Advanced Kubernetes Concepts

Once you're familiar with the basics of Kubernetes, it's time to dive into more advanced concepts to leverage the full power of this platform.

## Advanced Kubernetes Concepts

### StatefulSets

StatefulSets manage the deployment and scaling of a set of pods, and provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: k8s.gcr.io/nginx-slim:0.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Persistent Volumes

Persistent Volumes (PV) provide storage that persists beyond the life of individual pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0001
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/data
```

### Ingress Controllers

Ingress controllers manage external access to services within a Kubernetes cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: example-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

## Best Practices for Advanced Kubernetes Usage

- **Resource Requests and Limits:** Ensure proper resource allocation to avoid overloading nodes.
- **Namespaces:** Use namespaces to organize and manage resources efficiently.
- **Network Policies:** Define network policies to control traffic flow between pods.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement robust monitoring and logging solutions to keep track of cluster health.

## Conclusion

Advanced Kubernetes concepts like StatefulSets, Persistent Volumes, and Ingress Controllers provide greater control and flexibility in managing complex applications. Understanding and implementing these concepts can significantly enhance your Kubernetes deployments.
